Welcome to my personal website. This is my first time creating a website for a professional standout. When I first heard a demo given by Yuhui Xue on one of Rstudio's many conferences, I got to know about the use of Hugo + Blogdown, I really wanted one of mine, So here we go. 

Plus in this era of 2020, who even exists if they don't have a website, right?
