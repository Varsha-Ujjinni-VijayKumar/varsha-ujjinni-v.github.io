<h2>Overview üé•</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I will be reviewing an R package (How fun is that?), this package named <code>covid19ViewerShiny</code> is authored by <a href="https://github.com/ycui0008"><strong>Yuheng Cui</strong></a>, containing different functions, a dataset and a shiny application which depicts the <a href="https://covid19.who.int/">COVID19</a> pandemic which is currently running rampant throughout the world.</p>
<p>The development version of the package can be found in <a href="https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-ycui0008">GITHUB</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal of covid19ViewerShiny package is to a compact and consolidated way for users to visualize and understand the baneful effects of the pandemic. This package has a shiny dashboard that visualizes the condition of the pandemic in all countries of the world. It contains three functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>launch_app()</code> : This function helps the user launch the shiny dashboard for user interaction and more.</p></li>
<li><p><code>multiSelection()</code> : This function helps the user to create a drop list in the shiny application, which contains country names that the user wishes to view the condition of. This is a function which is for creating the user interaction with the app.</p></li>
<li><p><code>colPlot()</code> : This function is provided to create a column plot within the shiny app which visualizes the cumulative_cases and cumulative deaths of top 5 countries in each category.This function is for removing redundancy within the codes for creation of the plots.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What I think about the package? üí≠</h2>
<p>From the name, the README file and the pkgdown web page, it was quite clear what this package does, I expected this package to produce a shiny application with just one function, which shows the pandemic rise and the deaths associated within each country, a dataset and also three functions.</p>
<p>And I would say that the package delivered what was spoken of within the documentations and the name. The launch_app() is the main function for this app, it was easy for me to successfully run the function to get a shiny app without any extra work from my end. The files and folders are structured and I could find my way around them with ease.</p>
<p>The shiny app as spoken in the article by the author: <a href="https://etc5523-2020.github.io/r-package-assessment-ycui0008/articles/covid19ViewerShiny.html"><code>covid19 app</code></a>,contains four tabs within the app.I really like the layout of app, it is not too much information and cramped up. Just enough information for user‚Äôs understanding.</p>
<p>The application provides a slider input for the dates reflecting the cases based on the user‚Äôs input, a line graph which shows the cases within the countries chosen by the user.</p>

<div id="improvements-on-the-package-shiny-app-or-the-documetation" class="section level2">
<h2>Improvements on the package, shiny app or the documetation? üìù</h2>
<p>I would like to start off by saying the package itself as a whole is structured , accomplishes what is expected of it without any errors. Although I did notice that the test for server function <code>colPlot()</code> was not done, tests are very important when making a package, it gives a clear understanding to the developer whether the functions made are effective and working well for any type of input values.</p>
Coming to the shiny app, I really appreciate the efforts the author has taken to make this user effective, interactive app. One thing within the codes of the app is the use of HTML tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, I would like to add that the author does not have to write
<p>
tag for every line, as the
<p>
<p>tag does tell us it is a paragraph.</p>
<p>Lastly, the documentation, I was able to navigate myself through this R package thanks to the documentation made. There were three points that I would like to convey:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I found it to be very difficult for understanding how to give the arguments for the function, <code>colPlot()</code>, the function failed for me outside the app and I did try to find out different ways I could use it but in vain , would really appreciate it if that was given more clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>After running the command <code>renv::dependencies()</code> in the project, I found that a couple of R package were not mentioned in the DESCRIPTION file Suggests/Imports sections like janitor,usethis,tidyverse and pkgdown. <em>I would recommend using <code>renv::depenedencies</code> on the future packages to know which are the packages you can/should include.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, the documentation for the shiny app, as not all people who look at the visualizations can take away what the author is trying to convey, maybe a summary of each plot, if the page is completely filled , you could try using <code>tabset</code> for a better understanding of what is.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="takeaways" class="section level2">
<h2>Takeaways üìñ</h2>
<p>Other than being amazed by the amount of work put into the package, it is always a learning step when looking into the codes and ideas of other people. Easier way of implementing any code you thought otherwise, so it is always a pleasure to look at the codes which create such fantastic plots(the train of thought, <strong>All Aboard!</strong>).</p>
